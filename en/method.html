      <h2>Method</h2>
      <img src="/imagens/MÃ‰TODO/DSC_0004.jpg" alt="Foto do Professor Higor Pereira" class="foto-professor" />
      <p>
        I like to know all the details of the subjects I deal with, but since
        not all my students need to know everything, I tend to explain only what
        is necessary and guide the rest of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, I explain some critical factors that affect learning and consider the person who
        will learn to guide them on what will maximize their results. That is,
        each one has a tailor-made guidance according to their goals, needs and
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My proposal is to make my students get results sooner than they consider
        possible. I don't like spending years on what I can do in a few months.
        And it is this mindset that I transfer to my students. It is possible to
        make the process better as long as other approaches are considered.
      </p>
      <h3>Some techniques I use are:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>- Code-switching (to teach conversation)</li>
        <li>- Spaced Repetition (to fix what is studied)</li>
        <li>- Linkword (to fix some more difficult words)</li>
        <li>
          - Etymology (to understand in depth the concepts behind the words)
        </li>
        <li>- Shadowing (to improve pronunciation and increase fluency)</li>
        <li>- Soundshift (to retrieve vocabulary from pronunciation details)</li>
        <li>- Books (to follow some topics)</li>
        <li>- Apps (to facilitate reviews and insert some regular practice)</li>
        <li>- Flow state (to improve performance in the study)</li>
      </ul>

      <br />

      <p>
        All these techniques together provide optimized learning. It is possible
        that someone understands each one separately, but does not know how to
        use them together to benefit from it. I've noticed that I can explain
        everything as many times as I want, but there are some things that you
        only understand and learn when you see someone doing it in front of you.
        This same effect has been observed with myself. I read a guy's books and
        I thought I understood everything, but I only learned the last details
        when I got in touch with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to emphasize that the best techniques and the best
        teacher will only make sense to a disciplined, motivated and hardworking
        person. The best strategies and the best will of a teacher are
        ineffective for an undisciplined, lazy, unmotivated or arrogant person.
        Therefore, the method does not work for everyone, as it depends on the
        collaboration of the person who is interested. I can facilitate learning
        by showing the way, but I don't educate disorganized and uncommitted
        adults.
      </p>

        If you are a serious person, you will improve a lot with my
        lessons.
