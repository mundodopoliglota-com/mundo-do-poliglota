      <h2>Coaching</h2>
      <h3>
        Before getting to the main point, I need to explain something. It is
        impossible to understand what coaching is without knowing the origin of
        this word.
      </h3>
      <div class="coach-img">
        <img src="/imagens/COACHING/20150103_173208.jpg" alt="Foto do professor" />
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        Around the year 1400, in a small Hungarian town called Kocs, some wheel
        maker began to produce a type of carriage with a steel spring
        suspension. The name of this carriage was “kocsi szekér”. The word
        “szekér” means “chariot” in Hungarian. And “kocsi” is a reference to the
        city, as it is formed by “Kocs” (the name of the city) and “i”
        (Hungarian suffix to refer to the origin). A translation of "kocsi
        szekér" would be "Kocsian carriage".
      </p>
      <p>
        From Hungarian, this word entered the languages of countries bordering Hungary. In Czech one says
        “kočár”, in Slovak “koč” and eventually it reached German in the form of
        “Kutsche” and Dutch as “koets”. In Spanish and Portuguese, it arrived as
        “coche”. In Brazil, the term “coche” to refer to a carriage is not
        common, but it remained within the word “cocheiro” (person who drives
        the carriage), for example. And finally, in English, the term that
        arrived is “coach”.
      </p>
      <p>
        I once saw a famous Brazilian coach saying that the word “coach” came
        from “kocsi”, and that “kocsi” was a carriage in Hungary. As I study
        Hungarian and speak to some extent, I realized that this explanation is
        wrong. He may have read this information from a book by someone else who
        also didn't know and started to transmit it wrongly in his courses. By
        the way, I doubt that most people who work with some kind of coaching
        know this, because it's a detail that only those who know Hungarian
        would notice! Currently “kocsi” means “car” in Hungarian.
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw a course booklet by this same guy and noticed that it had errors in the parts
        where he tries to use neuroscientific terms. Every time someone tries to
        use a scientific term or a word from another language to impress, even
        if the person catches the attention of many and gets very rich selling
        expensive courses, he will always be perceived as he really is by those
        who know the words and the science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not long ago, a major TV channel made a program talking about the
        existence of charlatanism in coaching in Brazil. The biggest course
        sellers made videos advocating coaching and they are right to do so. But
        if they took the time to reflect, they would realize that they had
        created this problem themselves. When someone sells a course to
        thousands of people and distributes certificates without evaluating the
        quality of the participants, it causes that amount of people, which
        includes people who are unprepared, illiterate, rogue etc., to do things
        as they want and without quality. The same problem exists in other
        professions. It is necessary to carefully select someone who will work
        with people. Not everyone has the talent to deal with very different
        people. Coaching courses should be stricter about who can take them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then another guy from Brazil who works with coaching caught my
        attention. He calls himself a productivity coach and said he reads 50
        books in one year. I thought, this guy should be my coaching client,
        because I read over 180 books a year.
        Although in Brazil the term “coaching” has been somewhat tarnished by abusive practices of some
        marketers, the truth is that the concept itself is quite serious.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, this term was initially connected to sports. In
        the 90's, Anthony Robbins started to use it for advice on life issues
        and called it "life coaching". From it, others started to copy the word
        and use it for several other subjects that already existed before, but
        with it they were better translated. I've read his books, been to his
        event in the US, and I understand why this guy is so idolized by
        coaching audiences around the world. But, I'm against idolatry and my
        iconoclastic part sees some things I don't agree with in his approaches.
        Just to give you an idea, in the event I was, Anthony Robbins asked a
        woman “When was the last time you gave your husband a blowjob?” and
        there was too much aggression for him to sell his upcoming seminars with
        secrets to success. In one of the approaches, an employee of his said
        that anyone who did not have 10 thousand dollars to register for his
        next seminar, could make a loan. I don't like that sort of thing. People should be respected and there
        are things some people do that go beyond the line. Some people who
        idolize him turn a blind eye to these practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know and follow the content of people involved in coaching from different countries. I read,
        watch, learn and discard what I find objectionable. That part explained, it is worth telling about my trajectory.
      </p>
      <div class="coach-img">
        <img src="/imagens/COACHING/DSC01060.JPG" alt="Foto do professor" />
      </div>
      <p>
        I started reading personal development books and studying languages systematically at age 15. I have traveled a lot and keep friends in
        many countries. I notice that the interest in improving one's life is
        common to all the people I have met in the world. But there is a
        difference between willing to improve some aspects of your life and
        willing to improve yourself as a person. I've met very wealthy people
        who didn't care about their health, but were always excited to make more
        money. Or very intelligent people who have difficulty getting along with
        other people. In principle, it is very difficult to find a person who
        has all aspects of their life balanced and who is developing
        harmoniously. There is usually excessive worry within some aspect of life and a
        complete forgetfulness of other matters. That is, the person wants more
        money, but doesn't care about becoming more intelligent, or in another
        case, the person wants to have a relationship, but doesn't realize that
        they drive people away with their attitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is that everyone needs help. Usually people do not know how they are perceived by others
        and judge others based on feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a huge advantage for anyone in getting help. Help can be advice from a friend, advice from an
        expert, a consultation with an intelligent doctor etc. We all need help
        and advice at different times in life.
      </p>
      <div class="coach-img">
        <img src="/imagens/COACHING/20160227_155854.jpg" alt="Foto do professor" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The whole point of coaching is to provide concepts and strategies to
        enable improvements in someone's life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know so much about so many different countries and even though I am cultured and intellectual, I
        still like to gather information from some qualified people. I know the
        value of an idea. Sometimes a single idea can change everything in
        someone's life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world's greatest athletes like Usain Bolt, Michael
        Jordan, Dafne Schippers and Simone Biles need and keep one or more
        coaches throughout their careers. They know that many times talent is
        not enough. Someone is needed to point out where improvement is needed
        and coordinate what needs to be done. There was an Argentine tennis player who won
        against the 3 who are considered the best and then disappeared. Think
        about how a successful tennis career ceased to exist for details in the
        guy's personal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a lot of potential in the world that is still being wasted.
        American sales coach Grant Cardone said, "If you have the potential,
        it's unethical for you to live a moment not delivering to that
        potential." I partially agree with him. About someone failing to fulfill
        a purpose can be unethical, but there are times in life when someone
        doesn't have to obsess about succeeding and should just enjoy what they
        already have. This excessive preoccupation with succeeding is unhealthy
        and can be very costly. Take the case of the gymnast Diego Hypólito who
        is an olympic champion, but before that he had to suffer numerous
        injuries in a short period of time to reach his goal. The amount of
        injuries he has suffered is far greater than anyone would consciously
        accept to go through. Success is sometimes expensive and unhealthy. This
        may be an extreme example, but it is didactic. For people in general, there is always room for improvement in almost
        everything in their lives, but not necessarily all people are ready to
        deal with the cost of being too wildly successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a math student in a course of the famous professor Ricieri of the Instituto Tecnológico
        de Aeronáutica. He instilled in me the mindset of using mathematics to
        avoid waste and optimize processes. He gave examples of how mathematics
        and exact sciences can be used to solve business problems and also to
        solve problems in personal life. An executive makes better decisions
        when he understands mathematics. In the business environment, there is a
        lot of demand for coaching and consulting on different subjects, because
        executives want to improve the numbers of companies. All biographies of
        successful entrepreneurs are filled with times when they asked
        consultants for help. Likewise, in personal life there are also numbers
        that can be improved, with mathematics, science, and above all, ethics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the world of science and philosophy, relationships where someone
        received guidance from another who already knew the way had always
        existed. Aristotle, perhaps one of the greatest philosophers of all
        time, was a student of Plato for 20 years. Alexander III of Macedonia
        (known as Alexander the Great) was responsible for conquering the
        Persian Empire, Syria and Egypt in just 12 years. What many do not know
        is that he was a student of Aristotle since he was a child. Think of the
        size of the advantage he had in being a student of Aristotle. Aristotle
        saw several cities failing and others thriving and identified all the
        elements that lead to the prosperity of a people and an individual. He
        was an intellectual who covered almost all areas of knowledge in his
        time and left a vast literary production relevant to this day.
      </p>
      <div class="coach-img">

      </div>
      <p>
        Physicist Isaac Newton must have been one of the most intelligent people
        to ever walk the Earth. He once wrote in a letter the phrase "If I have
        seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." With this
        phrase, Newton referred to the great scientists who existed before him,
        such as Kepler, Galileo etc. In 2017, physicist Stephen Hawking said:
        "Each generation stands on the shoulders of those that came before, just
        as I did when I was a doctoral student at Cambridge, inspired by the
        work of Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell and Albert Einstein."
      </p>
      <p>
        Michael Faraday is a less famous physicist, but he had a spectacular
        trajectory. Ever since he was a child he wanted to be a scientist, but
        he didn't know how. Eventually he met a chemist named Humphry Davy and
        became his assistant in his laboratory. The years passed and he learned
        in practice how to be a scientist and surpassed his master. He performed
        several original experiments and left his name in the history of
        science.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's not obvious to you yet, I repeat, everyone needs help! These
        great philosophers, scientists and emperors of the past recognized that
        they didn't know everything and needed people to guide them. If the
        great do not hesitate to seek help, it is clear that seeking help is an
        act of greatness. Therefore, we must not be arrogant and think that we
        have the solutions for everything. It is often better to check how
        someone has already solved a problem you are experiencing than to
        reinvent the wheel, because not all people in the world are able to
        create new wheels. Anyone who wants to improve needs knowledge. Only
        people who want to grow see themselves for who they really are and do
        not ignore their own limitations. A different perspective from someone
        with knowledge can make a huge difference in a person's life.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now about my service. Within the coaching area, I can help with some
        topics, as I have already made more mistakes learning languages than
        many people will have time to make hits. I've read more books in the
        last decade than most people will read in a lifetime. All the knowledge
        I have accumulated about linguistics, management, mathematics,
        biographies, history and especially neuroscience, can be used to improve
        different aspects of a person's life.

      <p>
        I've helped my students increase their salary, save a marriage, and even
        keep their weight steady. I don't necessarily think about relationships,
        but I was able to help a student of mine because his problem was pretty
        obvious to me though it was imperceptible to him. This is not the main
        subject I deal with, but it is worth commenting.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your desire is to elevate your knowledge or your life to another
        level and you wish to receive help from a serious person, then you would
        benefit a lot from my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've noticed that almost everyone who
        has come in contact with me has improved in something. I know a lot of
        subjects and I always have something relevant to say. My goal is to help
        anyone using neuroscience, mathematics, management and linguistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked at what others are doing with coaching in Brazil and realized
        that no one is doing serious work using neuroscience. There are people
        using the words “neuroscience” and “quantum physics” as if they were
        good luck charms to attract customers and attract attention on the
        internet. Therefore, I decided to expand my professional field into
        coaching, because I know I have a lot to add. I have a high potential to
        add to the world and I want to use it to the fullest.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like
        to know more about having coaching sessions with me, get in touch! It
        will be a pleasure to contribute to your life with one of the many
        subjects I studied.
